- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davidly
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in photography, music, coding, and combinations of these.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on emulators. 6502 + Apple 1, 8080/Z80 + CP/M 2.2, and 8086 + DOS are about done. RISC-V is coming along.

The repos found here are apps I built for my own use and amusement. 

I code when I need a tool or am curious about something.
