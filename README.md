- 👋 Hi, I’m @davidly
- 👀 I’m interested in photography, music, coding, retro computing, and combinations of these.
- 🌱 I continue to test/enhance emulators that run apps targeting 6502 + Apple 1, 8080/Z80 + CP/M 2.2, 8086 + DOS 3.3, and 64-bit RISC-V + Linux.
- 👨‍💻 I'm building an Arm64 + Linux emulator.

The repos found here are apps I built for my own use and amusement. I code when I need a tool or am curious about something.

All of the code is freely available for use as you like.
