- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davidly
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in photography, music, coding, and combinations of these.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to write and optimize a compiler that targets x64, arm64, x86, arm32, 8086, 8080, and 6502.

The repos found here are apps I built for my own use and amusement. 

I code when I need a tool or am curious about something.
