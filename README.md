- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davidly
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in photography, music, coding, retro computing, and combinations of these.
- ðŸŒ± I recently built some emulators that run apps targeting 6502 + Apple 1, 8080/Z80 + CP/M 2.2, 8086 + DOS, and RISC-V + Linux.
- I've been playing with a bunch of RISC-V embedded systems for fun.

The repos found here are apps I built for my own use and amusement. I code when I need a tool or am curious about something.

All of the code is freely available for use as you like.
