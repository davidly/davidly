- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davidly
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in photography, music, coding, and combinations of these.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how interpreters for Python, Lua, Julia, and BASIC work and are optimized.

The repos found here are apps I built for my own use and amusement. I code when I need a tool or am curious about something.
